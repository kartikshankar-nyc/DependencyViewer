This experiment started from a need to quickly visualize cross dependencies across multiple systems at a "macro system or app" level. 
For now, all code (html/js/css) is in one file. I will clean it up later on. If anyone wants to enhance or clean this up further, feel free to do so right here. 

Note - this is a very trivial naive solution. Feel free to enhance/extend as required.

Usage - see below: Add Systems and Dependencies. and click on Generate Graph.

TODO://
Fix basic bugs - not showing multiple systems. 
Also check out Cytoscape.js and experiment with different examples.

Coming up: 
Upload csv to generate network graph
Provide users the ability to custom-specify what format of data they want vizualised as a network graph
